- coll state - icons should be active if something in the section is clicked (even nested link)
- coll state - links to useful pages
- publishing workflows is highlighted but when I click on Workflows, it's no longer active, but Workflows is highlighted
- only level zero is bold
- [K] root items expanders/collapsers - can they also be a link to dashboard

SH
- [K] confirm - footer item / should it have hover fx?
- remove data=icon
- dbl check those namespace comps.. too much ?
- auto opened items / cookies?


CH
- [K] webiny version / wcp logo
- expanding / collapsing sidebar - can we do something with text breaking into multiple
    lines and making the animation weird? Right now we have "wby-h-xl wby-whitespace-nowrap" in place.

::: RESOLVE WITH 2ND PR :::
- [K] icons check (FM icon?)
