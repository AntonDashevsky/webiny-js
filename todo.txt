KRESO CALL
1. link to pages / forms
  - sidebar collapzsed state - route to exising routes for v0
  - if I don't have groups / models, redirect first item in the list, like model list (what Leo said)
2. in collapsed state, icons should still be active if I'm in the route... like if I click on HCMS and I'm on dashboard, .. the same is if I click on nested item, when collapsed the icon should still be active
3. Publishing workflows is highlighted but when I click on Workflows, it's no longer active, but Workflows is highlighted
4. publishing workflows parent item bold only when nothing is selceted in children
5. avatar instead of icon for Webiny logo?
