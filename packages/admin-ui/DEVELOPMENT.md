# Overview
This document covers different aspects of the development process for the `@webiny/admin-ui` package.

## Tailwind CSS
Webiny's Admin app uses Tailwind CSS for styling.

### Tailwind Configuration
Tailwind CSS is configured as usual, via the [`tailwind.config.js`](./tailwind.config.js) file. Among other things, this file defines the default Webiny theme, which is based on Webiny's design system. More on this in the next section.

### Default Theme
One of the main things we define via the [`tailwind.config.js`](./tailwind.config.js) file is the default theme, which is based on Webiny's design system, and which can be found in this [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/f0QUDWX37Kt5X53eltTRiT/Webiny-Design-System?type=design&node-id=127-26352&mode=design&t=nhoOU7NamjWvImoW-0). 

But, do note that all the default theme-values are not actually defined in the `tailwind.config.js` file, but rather in the `tailwind.config.theme.js` file, which is a file that is generated from a Figma export (more on this in the next section).

### Figma To Code
Since manually transferring values from the mentioned Figma file into code has shown to be a very cumbersome process, we've created a script that basically takes a Figma export and generates all the necessary Tailwind CSS configuration. 

When we say "Figma export", we basically mean exports of (1) Primitives and (2) Alias tokens, which are created by this [Export/Import Variables](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1256972111705530093/export-import-variables) plugin.

The exports need to be downloaded and place into the `packages/admin-ui/scripts/importFromFigma/exports` folder. Ultimately, we should end up with the following two:

1. `packages/admin-ui/scripts/importFromFigma/exports/Alias tokens.json`
2. `packages/admin-ui/scripts/importFromFigma/exports/Primitives.json`

Finally, from project root, we run the following script:

```bash
yarn webiny-admin-import-from-figma
```

First, the script will regenerate the `tailwind.config.theme.js` file, which will contain all the necessary Tailwind CSS configuration. Second, it will also regenerate the `src/styles.scss` file, which contains actual values for CSS variables that are referenced in the `tailwind.config.theme.js` file.
