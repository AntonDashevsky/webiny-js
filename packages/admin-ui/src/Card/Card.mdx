# Cards

A Card component in design systems is a versatile UI element used to encapsulate content and actions about a single subject. It serves as a modular container that can include images, text, links, buttons, and other interactive elements. Cards are designed to present information in a concise and organized manner, making it easier for users to scan and interact with multiple pieces of content.
