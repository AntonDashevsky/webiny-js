### Use primary buttons sparingly
Use primary buttons as the desired action for users. Competing primary buttons may leave the user unsure of next steps in their user journey. As a rule of thumb limit primary buttons to 1 in contained UIs and 3 in full page UIs.

### Button Group
When used in groups, buttons should support only maximum of two type variants, with an exception of third variant being ghost extension button (eg. ellipsis). Avoid using random type and icon options within the button groups. Avoid using different sizes within the same group.
