# Grid

Grid structures layouts with clarity and consistency, organizing content, maintaining alignment, and ensuring a seamless experience across screen sizes. Settings include column configuration, gutter spacing, and responsive behavior.

<Canvas of={GridStories.Default} />

## Usage

```
import { Grid } from '@webiny/admin-ui';
```

## Horizontal Grids
The grids within the Webiny Design System behave as fixed and fluid elements relevant to the elements on the page.

### Grid types
Webiny Design System use two types of grids: fluid and fixed. Both grid types use breakpoints to determine whether the layout needs to change between viewport sizes.

### Fluid
The fluid grid stretches across an area to fill all available space within the screen, part of the screen or within the specific element if needed.

### Fixed
The fixed grid applies the ideal maximum width to page or page element.

## Grid Gutter Sizes
We considered using two main sizes for grid application, to be used dependent on the content type.

### Comfortable (Default)

### Spacious

## Breakpoints
A breakpoint marks the point where a websiteâ€™s layout adapts to provide the best user experience. In responsive design, the range of each breakpoint defines the ideal number of columns for a given viewport size, along with the suggested widths for margins and gutters.

## Column Spans
Content should be distributed across a minimum of 3 columns, with the option to extend up to 12 columns. To achieve a range of layouts, vary the number of columns used, allowing for flexible design across different breakpoints.

## Column Offsets
Content isn't required to span the full 12 columns. It can cover a smaller number of columns, creating a layout where the content is centered within a 12-column grid.
