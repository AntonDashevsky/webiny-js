- [K] confirm - footer item / should it have hover fx?
- remove data=icon
- dbl check those namespace comps.. too much ?
- auto opened items / cookies?

CH
- expanding / collapsing sidebar - can we do something with text breaking into multiple
    lines and making the animation weird? Right now we have "wby-h-xl wby-whitespace-nowrap" in place.
