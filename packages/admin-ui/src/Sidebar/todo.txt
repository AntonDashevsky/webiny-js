    - dbl check styles

- dbl check those namespace comps... too much ?

CH/NTH
- improve collapsing of sidebar (clicking on header chevron briefly shows the expand icon that's shown on hover)
- dropdown positioning (footer)
- test more than 1 level of nesting
- action on collapsibles (an additional action with the chevron)?
- footer - focused state space/enter does not trigger dropdown
- auto opened items / cookies?
- defaultOpen
- expanding / collapsing sidebar - can we do something with text breaking into multiple
    lines and making the animation weird? Right now we have "wby-h-xl wby-whitespace-nowrap" in place.

::: RESOLVE WITH 2ND PR :::
- [K] icons check (FM icon?)
- [K] webiny version / wcp logo
